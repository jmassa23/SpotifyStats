# SpotifyStats

One of my good friends was showing me an app that he paid a few dollars for. It showed him the complete history of his spotify account; his most listened to songs and artists and how many times/minutes he listened to each of them. I then come to find out that the data can actually be requested from Spotify for free. In the app you're just paying for the nice interface and for the simple data analysis to be done for you. Each "song listen" is just a json object, so a quick python script should give me the functionality I want.

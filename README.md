# SpotifyStats

One of my good friends was showing me an app that he paid a few dollars for and it showed him the complete history of his spotify account. His most listened to songs and artists and how many times/minutes he listened to each of them. I then come to find out that the data can actually be requested from Spotify for free. All the app that my friend was using did was format the data and present it to him in a neat way. Each "song listen" is just a json file, so a quick python script should give me the functionality I want.
